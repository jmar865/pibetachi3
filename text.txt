What We Do

Academics: “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” Believing in the merits of this quote by Nelson Mandela, PBX facilitates and encourages its members to achieve excellence in their academics. Our Chapters strategically pick housing near campus libraries, our members often combine their notes and study together, and senior members will pass down their old notes, study guides, and knowledge to younger members. In doing these, PBX provides an educational advantage to its members not enjoyed by outsiders. We are known to graduate with honors and go on to pursue advanced degrees in business, law, and science.

Social: As a social organization, our Chapters responsibly host and attend house parties, basement parties, lawn parties, band parties, pig roasts, seafood boils, formals, semi-formals, reunions, anniversaries, and mixers with sororities and women’s sports teams and clubs. Our social events are often in correlation with our philanthropic efforts, such as when we have a pig roast and invite the community to come and donate to our sponsored philanthropy organizations. 

Philanthropy: Philanthropy is a powerful way to positively influence the world. As such, PBX supports numerous philanthropy organizations to help the less fortunate and advance honorable causes. We do this by hosting fundraisers, collecting donations from parents and alumni, and raising awareness for our sponsored organizations. Our causes and organizations include cancer research with the Jimmy V Foundation, building strong youth with the Boys and Girls Club, supporting our veterans with the Wounded Warrior Project, and more. Because PBX promotes Chapter freedom and individuality, each Chapter chooses their own organizations to support. 

Community Service: Our Chapters are proud and loyal members of their communities which we enjoy every opportunity to give back to. Our community service initiatives include adopting neighborhood streets to keep clean, cooking for the homeless, being mentors for the Big Brothers Big Sisters organization, volunteering at local schools, fostering animals, hosting barbecues for emergency responders, building homes with the Habitat for Humanity organization, and hosting donation drives. Every community is unique, so each Chapter chooses their own community service initiatives to be most helpful to their specific community.

Entrepreneurialism: Fraternity life is a constant collaboration between like-minded individuals with similar ethics and ambitions. This environment appeals to driven and hard workers, and it spurs unique and progressive ideas which often turn in to entrepreneurial initiatives born right out of the Chapter house. Furthermore, running a Fraternity is great practice for running a business as it teaches you how to create and manage a budget, enforce a risk management policy, interface with school and public officials, lease and manage real estate, build and market your Chapter’s brand, recruit new members, compete with other organizations, manage an insurance policy, maintain a legal entity, stay in good standing with the IRS, and more – an outstanding educational experience not replicable in a classroom.

Athletics: PBX competes in numerous athletic venues both on and off campus. Our members play on school teams, club teams, community teams, inter-fraternity league teams, and on sorority-fundraiser teams. We also host our own athletic events as fundraisers for our philanthropy and community service initiatives. Additionally, our Chapters often sponsor local children’s teams and coach them as well.

Bhood: PBX is a Brotherhood unlike any other. Shared experiences and time-spent-together are what create the bonds of a strong Brotherhood. To build these bonds, each Chapter has a Brotherhood Committee which plans events and outings to get their members together and having memorable experiences. Brotherhood events can include things as simple as ordering pizza and watching sports at the Chapter house, bowling, river tubing trips, and paintball. They can also include things as grand as camping trips, rafting through the Grand Canyon for a week, heli-skiing trips, and international travel.  

Networking: A great benefit of PBX membership is being in a broad but tight network of Brothers from all Chapters, their alumni, and their families. This network can be utilized to collect donations and investments, to find summer lodging during an internship, to review resumes, to apply for jobs, to find friends in a new city, to partner with on a startup, etc. Our members also network with sororities and the rest of Greek Life, women’s school and club sports teams, and other school organizations such as the school newspaper and student government. Outside of school, we network with City Councils, community service and philanthropy organizations, political and civil rights organizations, and more. In short, our members meet and work with a lot of people, and our alumni like to help out their successors.

Chapter Resources

By-Laws are the rules which govern a Chapter and its members. They give leadership positions their power, specify how members can vote, explain how to ratify a budget, say how to transfer leadership, and much more. Chapter By-Laws are like the Constitution of a Chapter. When opportunities or problems arise, you consult the By-Laws for resolution. As such, it is very important for each Chapter to have clear, concise, and thorough By-Laws. This document is our By-Laws for new Chapters. These By-Laws may be amended and updated per the rules set forth within.

Each Chapter has several leadership positions for its members to fill. There are Executive Board positions like President and Treasurer, Committee positions like Brotherhood Committee Chairman and Recruitment Committee member, and one-man positions such as Chapter Historian and House Manager. Every position is important and tantamount to a Chapter’s ability to reach their full potential. This document is a list of the common leadership positions (you can create one not on this list) and their responsibilities.

Committees are what allow every single member to be a leader and contribute directly to their Chapter’s success at any time. There are the Brotherhood, Recruitment, Social, and Scholarship committees to name a few. Each committee has a Chairman and multiple committeemen. The Chairmen are elected and the committeemen are any members which wish to serve. Some Chapters mandate that every member be on at least three committees at all times. Being an effective committeeman is a great way to show your leadership potential and step towards higher positions. This document explains each Committee and how to make them successful. 

The Points System is a way to establish seniority between members within the organization. This is helpful to resolve disputes such as who gets the best room in the house, who gets the last spot on the trip, etc. Some members are older, but other members have held more positions, and others have better grades, so it can be tough to establish a clear hierarchy. The Points System rewards leadership experience and academic performance, and it penalizes riskiness. Like the By-Laws, it can be amended to best suit each Chapter.

The Fraternal Information and Programming Group (FIPG) Policy is PBX’s definitive risk management policy. Its purpose is to make our experience a safer one for all of our members and guests. It establishes rules and practices to prevent physical and psychological harm, and to protect us from liability risk. It addresses topics such as alcohol consumption, drug use, hazing, assault, hosting events, fire prevention and property safety, responsibilities of Chapter leaders, and the education of new members. This document describes the history of FIPG, why it is needed, the policy itself, how to effectively implement it, and how to educate members on it. 

Pledging PBX is an enjoyable and educational experience which transforms new members in to contributing Brothers and leaders. Through this, pledges learn how their Chapter and national organization work, the many leadership positions, the committee system, how to recruit top-quality new members, risk management, and how to present themselves in both social and professional settings as respectable gentlemen. Each pledge class mimics the structure of their Chapter by having their own Executive Board and committees (like a pledge Brotherhood committee which plans Brotherhood events just for the pledges) so that every pledge obtains real leadership experience even before joining the Chapter. This document details our advanced and exclusive process for building new Chapter leaders.

The health and safety of our members are of utmost concern and consideration. PBX offers numerous resources to promote and sustain healthy habits among our members. Such resources include information, memberships, discounts, and promotions for providers of services and products which encourage strong mental and physical health. This is the list of these offerings and how to utilize them.

Many of our Chapters own or rent their Chapter houses and are responsible for managing them. Property management is a broad term which includes landscaping guidelines, interior maintenance and repair plans, managing house funds and savings, handling security deposits, collecting and making rent and mortgage payments, tenant transition procedures, and understanding lease rules and laws. Property management also includes external affairs such as finding more properties to rent and buy, negotiating rental and purchase agreements, and maintaining positive relationships with our landlords and neighbors. This document contains our strategies and processes for achieving these.

Rush is typically a two week process consisting of numerous events and activities for potential new members to attend and meet our Brothers. These events are casual in nature and can include things like cookouts at the house, lawn games, bowling, paintball, pick-up sports games, order pizza and watch professional sports, etc. This document is a sample Rush calendar which can be circulated around campus physically and digitally. 

Chapters run on a routine schedule every semester with several important events happening at the same point within each semester. Such events include Rush week, bid extensions, initiation, philanthropy fundraisers, social and brotherhood events, educational meetings, document due dates, payment due dates, and more. It is important for these dates to be known at the beginning of each semester so that Chapter leaders and committees can aim to meet them. This document is a calendar for our Chapters to use as a template to guide their work and achievements throughout the semester. Some dates are firm such as payment due dates, and others are flexible such as Philanthropy week.
