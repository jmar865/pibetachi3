Brothers work together and hold each other accountable to achieving their common goals and values. Through thick and thin, Brothers are there in times of need and in times of celebration. Brothers are your best men and they are your pallbearers. In Pi Beta Chi, Brotherhood is shared with the men you graduate with and it is shared with the men who graduated a century ago.</p>

                                        <p>Character is the combination of traits and qualities of a person that you can not see. Through academics, philanthropy, service work, leadership experience, and mentorship, Pi Beta Chi builds its members up and in to men of strong Character who embody honesty, accountability, confidence, and discipline. Strong Character is imperative to success in college and in life as it exudes trustworthiness, influence, and stands in the face of opposition. As such, Pi Beta Chi pushes its members to strengthen their Character whether it be in the library, at community service, or on their Executive Board.</p>

                                        <p>The greatest Fraternity experience is the opportunity to be an authentic leader of your organization. This is an unparalleled educational experience that instills responsibility, accountability, management, communication, negotiation, networking and many more invaluable skills that can not be taught in a classroom. Fraternity leaders are directly responsible for their organization's success and face character-building challenges such as collecting dues from friends, making and sticking to a balanced budget, communicating with school and town administrations, networking with local charities, negotiating with landlords and businesses, creating and enforcing risk management policies, and countless more. Pi Beta Chi strongly encourages all of its members to hold leadership positions. Members may hold an Executive Board position of President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Risk Manager; be a Chairman for one of several committees such as the Recruitment Committee and Philanthropy committee; serve as a Committeeman on a Committee; or make up their own position such as Chapter Historian or House Manager.</p>

                                        <p>The most defining characteristic of Pi Beta Chi is our relentless and unwavering pursuit of Freedom – the right to act, speak, think, and organize as one wants without hindrance or restraint from tyranny. In accordance with this philosophy, our Chapters are not required to be directly affiliated with a specific school or be infringed upon by any institution other than their own. Our members proudly exercise and defend their Constitutional right of association. Additionally, they choose their own community service opportunities and philanthropies to support, and they write and enforce their own By-Laws. This self-governance is a unique and invaluable experience for our future leaders and entrepreneurs.</p>
