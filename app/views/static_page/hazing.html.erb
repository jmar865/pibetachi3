                Pi Beta Chi is a NON HAZING organization. No chapter, colony, student or alumnus should conduct, participate in or condone hazing activities. Permission or approval by a person being hazed is not a defense. Our definition of hazing is comprised of our insurance policyâ€™s definition of hazing and the hazing definitions of the governments which we operate under. You can read these definitions below.  
                <br><br>
                If you or someone has been hazed, may be hazed in the future, or is in any way threatened by hazing, you should call 911 or your local police department immediately. Additionally, you can call a hazing hotline or visit online resources such as hazingprevention.org and stophazing.org.
